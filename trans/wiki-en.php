$_TXT[22] = 'What if I need some precise holes / pockets on my panel?';
$_TXT[23] = 'Usually we make holes and pockets <b>0,05mm bigger</b>. It means that a pocket of size 20 x 20mm will be sent to the machine as 20,05 x 20,05mm. Keep this in your mind, if you have some holes on your panel which need to be as precise as possible. Easiest way is to modify your hole/pocket so it is 0,05mm smaller and you have a good chance to have it precise. But we can\'t guarantee your hole will be exactly 20.00mm anyway. Especially if you order panel with surface anodised.';

Traces are rectangular (in rectangular pocket) and circular in circular pocket.';
$_TXT[28] = 'What is maximum depth of blind threads?';
$_TXT[29] = 'Maximum depth of the blind thread recommended is : <br /> <b>PANEL THICKNESS minus 1mm</b><br /> It means that for panel thickness of 5mm it is 4mm maximum depth.

$_TXT[30] = 'Quality of anodising';
$_TXT[31] = 'Anodising is a surface treatment technology which ensures harder surface, prevents oxidation of panel and allows coloring the surface. During anodising, the panel must hang in the anodising bath. Panel hangs on some kind of thin wires. It means there will be two small (almost invisible) dots on the edge of holes selected for hanging the panel. Usually they hang it using holes with countersink for screw heads so these marks will not be visible after assembling. If you require panel without any visible marks, please read question "How to make anodising as perfect as possible?".';
$_TXT[32] = 'How to make anodising as perfect as possible?';
$_TXT[33] = 'If you want to have your panel anodised without any visible marks due to clamping technology of anodising, you can do it this way: <br> Add two blind threads to the backside of your panel. These threads must be size M3 and they will be used for hanging the panel in anodising bath. Threads should be placed at opposite ends of the panel. Maximum depth of such thread is <b>PANEL THICKNESS minus 1.5mm</b>. This strategy is <b>available only for panel thickness 3mm and more!</b> After you send an order for such panel, you must <b>write us an email about these threads</b> so we can inform anodising company. <br> For panels less than 3mm thick you can inform us, which holes you prefer for hanging in the anodising bath.';
